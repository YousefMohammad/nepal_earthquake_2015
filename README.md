## **Overview**

<font size ='+0'>The Nepal earthquake of 2015 was a severe earthquake that struck near the city of Kathmandu in central Nepal on `April 25, 2015`. About `9,000` people were killed, many thousands more were injured, and more than `600,000` structures in Kathmandu and other nearby towns were either damaged or destroyed. The earthquake was felt throughout central and eastern Nepal, much of the Ganges River plain in northern India, and northwestern Bangladesh, as well as in the southern parts of the Plateau of Tibet and western Bhutan.</font>

## **Project Idea**

<font size ='+0'>Predicting the Grade of the damage using multiple features to take the necessary precautions and decreasing the number of injuries or maybe the number of buildings or develop the structure to avoid earthquake damage.</font>
